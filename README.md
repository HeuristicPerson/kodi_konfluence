A \[K\]onfluence Zeitgeist
==========================

**IMPORTANT!** "A \[K\]onfluence Zeitgeist" is just a very small modification of
the theme "A Confluence Zeitgeist" created by XXX. My suggestion is to first try
it for a while and then, check this small mod later.

This are the changes I introduced in the theme:

  1. Removal the Kodi logo from main screen.

  2. Added a "kiosk" mode in settings menu so you can block access to side bar
     menus. This is specially useful for kids, elders, or any non-tech people
     who want or need a simpler interface.

  3. Album fanart while playing (WIP).

  4. New backgrounds (you know, when I install Kodi in a new machine I don't
     want to be searching around for good looking images).
